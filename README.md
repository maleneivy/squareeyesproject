Square Eyes is an independent movie site for both producers and watchers. 
The target audience for people aged 25-40 and who loves cinemas. 

The website is a cross-course project I have been working on from the beginning of my learning progress at Noroff. 
In this project I've worked with UI-design, UX-design and the code.
